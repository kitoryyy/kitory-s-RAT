# Kitory's RAT

A remote trojan that was made using python with custom commands



## Features

- listfiles - shows the files in a directory
- sysinfo - shows the system info about the zombie pc
- screenshot - makes a screenshot using imgdb and gives you the link to it


## How to setup

Well theres nothing much u just need to get an api key from [imgdb](https://imgbb.com/api) once you got it you need to run the req install command.

```pip install requirements.txt```

Then you just need to make your port and ip adress in both of the files.

From there you need to put the api key at line 15 in zombie.py. and with some common sense watch a youtube tutorial on how to make it an exe and auto exec when a usb is plugged in. And to make it a  RAT just get acces to the users pc and make it a startup app by making an "installer"






## WARNING

I WILL NOT BE BLAMED FOR THE DAMAGE YOU DO WITH THIS
